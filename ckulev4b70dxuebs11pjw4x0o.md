# Should You Code Along In Machine Learning and Data Science

# Why you should give attention to your learning system?
As an ML engineer or a Data Scientist, You may found yourself have to consume a lot of learning materials like books, online courses, YouTube videos, or blog posts. If you are going throw all of these materials without a proper way to deal with all of this information you will find yourself overwhelmed and lost!. ML and DS technologies are changing very fast more than in any other field. Even more normal software engineering itself!!!. From this point, you should have **a  sold system of learning** and consuming all of these materials.


# Is coding a long bad idea?

You can think of "code along" as something in between. At least it is not the bad thing you can do when you are watching tutorials. 

The worst thing you can do is setting without doing anything. Nothing can be worse than that. 

Coding along can help you if you are learning the **basics**. But you will find it quite hard to code and understand the materials at the same time if the content is more **complex** or **advanced**. 

Basically what you are trying to do is **doing multiple things at once**. this costs your brain a lot of energy when you switching from understanding mode to coding mode over and over again multiple times at the same tutorial you are **depleting** your limited source of energy!!.

This is quite obvious if you are dealing with more advanced topics that need a clear mind to understand. 

> It is an okay approach if are doing a simple thing but you can't generalize this to more complex problems. 

To illustrate this a bit further. You can have short scripts that are completed and long scripts that are simple.

The reason why this is very important is that in ML and DS we have ** high-level** libraries that do all of the things to us like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. With just a couple of lines of code, you can create a neural network and start making predictions. The reality is that there is a lot of complex logic going on behind the senses.


# Think Seed and Coding Speed 

A common **false impression** you may acquire from watching online tutorials is the development process should go smoothly without any complications. This is totally different from reality. The reality is you will encounter a lot of obstacles when you are working on such a problem. So what you are saying in these tutorials in the **last version** of the code.

# Can we do better?
You can't understand complex materials and code at the same time. You can do better than that. You will still code but this time after the tutorial is finished. But what will you be doing during the tutorial? You will do your best to understand the **Fundamental concepts**. A lot of the ML and DS content is based on theory and some math. Your goal is to understand the science behind all of these concepts. Then you can focus on coding all of this stuff after the tutorial.

# Why paying attention to the "Fundamental concepts" is the key?

Libraries are evolving very fast. A lot of libraries are changing their API. Some new better libraries come up every while!!. It is impossible to learn all of them. What you can do is Masting the fundamentals that all of these libraries are using behind the senses. Don't be afraid to open the code of the package and go throw the code itself. 


# Conclustion 
1. Coding along in the overall picture: it's in-between 
2. the worst thing to do is to set and do nothing 
3. It is an okay approach if are doing a simple thing but you can't generalize this to more complex problems.  
4. Pretty bad when the content becomes complex 
5. You can have short scripts that are completed and long scripts that is simple
6. Your thinking speed is not equal to your coding speed 
7. Don't be fooled by the coding speed in the online tutorials    
8. If you are really want to code along so Pause the video as needed
9.  Understand the concepts 
10. "Learn the principles, not the syntax"
11. Pay attention to the design and flow of data
